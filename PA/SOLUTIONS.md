### Requirements

Conference organizer needs a management system for the conferences he runs for both speakers and attendees

Users: hundreds of speakers, dozens of event staff, thousands of attendees
Requirements:
attendees can access speaking schedule online, including room assignments
speakers can manage talks (enter, edit, modify)
attendees 'vote up/down' talks
organizer can notify attendees of schedule changes up-to-the-minute (if attendees opt in)
each conference (being a different subject) can be branded independently
speaker slides are accessible online only to attendees
evaluation system via web page, email, SMS, or phone
#### Additional Context:
Conference runs across the US.
Very small support staff.
'Bursty' traffic: extremely busy when conference is occurring.
Conference organizer wants to easily 'skin' the site for different technology offerings.


Based on the requirements and additional context you provided, here's a draft for the product architecture:

**Requirements:**
1. Attendees can access speaking schedules online, including room assignments.
2. Speakers can manage talks (enter, edit, modify).
3. Attendees can 'vote up/down' talks.
4. Organizer can notify attendees of schedule changes up-to-the-minute (if attendees opt in).
5. Each conference can be branded independently.
6. Speaker slides are accessible online only to attendees.
7. Evaluation system via web page, email, SMS, or phone.

**Solution Implementation:**

1. **Speaking Schedules & Room Assignments:**
   - A database will be created to store conference schedules and room assignments.
   - A user-friendly web interface will allow attendees to access and view schedules.
   - Mobile application support for both iOS and Android devices to access schedules on-the-go.

2. **Speaker Talk Management:**
   - A dedicated web portal for speakers where they can log in and manage their talks.
   - Integration with popular presentation software (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides) to facilitate easy upload and editing of talks.
   - Version control for managing edits and modifications.

3. **Attendee Voting:**
   - A voting system embedded within the web interface and mobile application.
   - Attendees can vote up/down on talks they attended.
   - A backend system to tally votes and display results to organizers and speakers.

4. **Real-Time Notifications:**
   - Integration with push notification services for real-time updates.
   - Opt-in system for attendees to receive notifications.
   - Support for SMS and email notifications as well.

5. **Branding for Each Conference:**
   - A templating system that allows the organizer to 'skin' the website and mobile application for each conference.
   - Support for custom logos, color schemes, and other branding elements.
   - Integration with popular design tools (e.g., Adobe Photoshop, Sketch) for easy importing of design assets.

6. **Speaker Slide Accessibility:**
   - A secure cloud storage system for uploading and accessing speaker slides.
   - Access control to ensure only registered attendees can view slides.
   - Integration with presentation tools to allow direct viewing of slides within the web interface or mobile application.

7. **Evaluation System:**
   - A multi-channel evaluation system that supports web pages, emails, SMS, and phone calls.
   - Integration with popular email and SMS services for sending out evaluation forms.
   - A backend system for collecting and analyzing evaluation data.

Considering the "bursty" traffic during conference times, the system should be built on a scalable infrastructure that can handle traffic spikes. Cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud can be used to ensure the system scales up during high-traffic periods and scales down during off-peak times to save costs.

A user-friendly CMS (Content Management System) should be used to allow the small support staff to easily manage content and make updates without much technical knowledge.
